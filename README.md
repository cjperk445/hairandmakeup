## Wireframes

Created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com)

When creating the wireframes I worked from the mobile size up, as most consumers view websites foremostly on mobile devices. All throughout the build I focused on the mobile view and then scaled up device sizes.

First Sketch of a phone or similar size device (put in screen size here):

I then scaled up the sketches for tablet/landscape phones

Finally, I sketched a wireframe for laptop and larger devices

## About the build:

### index.html
I started the project and created all of the required pages: index.html, contact.html, portfolio.html,<br>

I created the assets and images folder, further on I would seperate the images folder into sub-sections as there were numerous styles of work on offer, these further sub-folders were labelled Hair, Makeup, Awards and Readme. This will hopefully make it easy to navigate to specific images within the folder tree.

### contact.html

### portfolio.html


added basic structure of main page, used bootstrap nav bar, will edit for own function later. 
added css stylesheet, including css variables for main color scheme. 
had to change colour scheme as there was not enough contrast with the primary and highlight colors used https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ to check. 
made an error whilst creating favicon, had to remake it with better size of logo so it would show up better on the tab
11/12/2024 decided to remove social bar from top of the screen and added to the navbar, made sure to center it on smaller screens, then spaced them out ans shrunk them on larger screen
