added basic structure of main page, used bootstrap nav bar, will edit for own function later. 
added css stylesheet, including css variables for main color scheme. 
had to change colour scheme as there was not enough contrast with the primary and highlight colors used https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ to check. 
made an error whilst creating favicon, had to remake it with better size of logo so it would show up better on the tab
11/12/2024 decided to remove social bar from top of the screen and added to the navbar, made sure to center it on smaller screens, then spaced them out ans shrunk them on larger screen
