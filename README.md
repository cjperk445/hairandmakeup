## Wireframes

Created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com)

I created the wireframes using Balsamiq, I wanted to focus on mobile devices and scale up to larger devices. However I sketched the laptop size initially.

The first sketch for laptops and larger screens(â‰¥992px)
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="assets/images/readme/1_wireframe.png" width="33%" height="33%" alt="first sketch laptop size">
</div>

The second sketch which is the design i went for added an about me section at the top and squeezed the divs into a smaller space to make better use of the screen space
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="assets/images/readme/2_wireframe.png" width="33%" height="33%" alt="second sketch laptop size">
</div>

With this second sketch in mind I went on and sketched the website on a mobile device (<576px)
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="assets/images/readme/4_wireframe.png" width="33%" height="33%" alt="mobile device sketch">
</div>

Once I was happy I went on to sketch the portfolio page. Early on I'd decided to take inspiration from the love running project that the website would have a masonry wall approach and a seperate CV area at the bottom. The masonry wall would be responsive to the screen size as the sketch below illustrates, it would be utilising the CSS column-count property. 
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="assets/images/readme/5_wireframe.png" width="33%" height="33%" alt="mobile device portfolio sketch">
<img src="assets/images/readme/6_wireframe.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="sketch of portfolio page different screen sizes" style="vertical-align:top">
</div>

Then the Contact Page: 
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="assets/images/readme/7_wireframe.png" width="33%" height="33%" alt="mobile device contact sketch">
<img src="assets/images/readme/8_wireframe.png" width="33%" height="33%" alt="laptop or larger contact page" style="vertical-align:top">
</div>


Whilst building and testing the site the social media links at the top of the page were not as aesthetically pleasing as I wanted so I moved the logos to sit next to the nav links in the navbar. 
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="assets/images/readme/3_wireframe.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="move social media logos">
</div>

## About the build:

### index.html
I started the project and created all of the required pages: index.html, contact.html, portfolio.html,<br>

I created the assets and images folder, further on I would seperate the images folder into sub-sections as there were numerous styles of work on offer, these further sub-folders were labelled Hair, Makeup, Awards and Readme. This will hopefully make it easy to navigate to specific images within the folder tree.

### contact.html

### portfolio.html


added basic structure of main page, used bootstrap nav bar, will edit for own function later. 
added css stylesheet, including css variables for main color scheme. 
had to change colour scheme as there was not enough contrast with the primary and highlight colors used https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ to check. 
made an error whilst creating favicon, had to remake it with better size of logo so it would show up better on the tab
11/12/2024 decided to remove social bar from top of the screen and added to the navbar, made sure to center it on smaller screens, then spaced them out ans shrunk them on larger screen
